# API movie website
In this project i used the movie database api to make a website about movies. I used technologies like Express, EJS en a few Web API's. 

## Week 1
First week i had to think of a concept for this project. I was inbetween a chat application or movie website. I first wanted to try out the chat application, to see if it's not too hard. I used packages like Socket.io and then ws. I was able to make one chat using websockets. But adding more functionalities turned out to be really hard. So i gave up the idea and changed the concept. 

## Week 2
This week i got sick so i didn't do alot of thing. But i was certain now that i wanted to make a website using MovieDB api. I wanted to make a website where the user can search for movies and series and see a detail page, search by genre and adding movies/series to favorites. I started making my first API call and get all the data i needed to make the website. I started with my home page where a overview of popular movies/series will be shown. I tried to use the code in the example and use Tinyhttp and Liquid. But i did't like it so i changed it and used express and ejs, because i find them easier to use.

## Week 3
I continued making my homepage and made the detail page. I first started focussing mostly on making the functionalities work and added no css yet. I also started looking for different Web Api's. I used the Web Share API and the Web Speech API. I played around with them for a bit. The Web Share API was pretty easy to use, but the Web Speech API was abit harder to use. Turns out there is a limit that would constantly give me errors. In the weekend i started applying css.

## Week 4
I continued to focus on the css and noticed while tweaking with the Web Speech API it stopped working suddenly. I tried to figure out why, deleted my code and recreated it but as it turns out there is a limit on how many times you can use the web speech api. And it doesn't give a clear error why. I let the Web Speech API for what it is, still working.
